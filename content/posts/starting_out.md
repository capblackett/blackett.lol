## Ahoy there.
All too often I see kids in our Discord server who want to get started learning tech but have no clue how to begin. That's okay, it's not an easy question to know the answer to unless you already work in tech.

Many seem to have misunderstood and think that ethical hacking is the starting point. Sadly, following endless YouTube tutorials only shows you how to do the things depicted in the tutorials and teaches you none of the underlying context, problem solving skills, and analysis required to be an ethical hacker. The job is too complicated to be covered by YouTube videos.

So where do you start? You've got to start _somewhere,_ right? Well buckle up kids, we're about to delve into a "somewhere" as good as any that won't leave you confused and lost.

## Why Learn This Way? {#1-why}

Why not learn hacking first? Hacking is what you want to do, right? Well what are you going to hack, sir? If you eventually land a job as a [penetration tester](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/security/glossary/what-is-penetration-testing/) you will be attacking business infrastructure to help a security team find flaws in their security plans.

Here's a fun one to try. Can you find the fault in the blueprint below?
